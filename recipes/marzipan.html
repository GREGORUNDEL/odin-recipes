        <h2>Recipe description</h2>
          <p>Marzipan is a sweet almond-based treat, smooth in texture and rich in flavor. Made from ground almonds and sugar, it has a delicate nutty taste that pairs beautifully with its natural sweetness. Popular across Europe, marzipan is often used for candies, cake decorations, and festive desserts.</p>
          <p>This simple homemade version is soft, pliable, and delicious on its own or shaped into small figures. It can also be dipped in chocolate or used as a filling for pastries. Its versatility and melt-in-the-mouth texture make it a favorite for both casual snacking and special occasions.</p>
